# CISC325-Group22

Repository for Group 22's CISC325 High Fidelity Prototype

# Current Functionality:

Teacher Homepage

- Users can interact with menu buttons to navigate the site. Most of those pages don't exist yet, so expect some 404 errors.
- Individual projects can be selected from the table. For this prototype, they will all redirect to the same demo project.
- New projects can be added with the "New Project" button, updating the table instantly. However they will disappear upon page refresh because this prototype does not have backend database functionality.

Student Project Page

- Users can drag around blocks between the input, operator and block bank areas of the page. The output area updates automatically as blocks are moved.
- Currently only has support for very basic math operations using some demo blocks. In a full implementation, these blocks and their combination outputs would be pulled from a database of projects created by a teacher user.

Known Issues:

- Block bank CSS can't fit more than four blocks at once
- Block text isn't vertically centered
